# awesome-wm-config
The configuration files for how I like to run Awesome Window Manager.

# Goals
## Consistent keyboard workflow
The idea behind the configuration is to create a keyboard driven workflow that is consistent across any application i use on a regular basis that can be configured. Right now, that includes:
- TMUX
- VIM
- Firefox -- Using the Vimium add-on
- Obsidian
- Awesome
